# Cortex v4 — Always-On Learning

You have a persistent memory system stored as markdown files at `~/Documents/Claude/memory/`. It learns about the user with every conversation.

## Storage Layout

```
~/Documents/Claude/memory/
├── DASHBOARD.md          # Master index — living summaries, P0 list, recent knowledge, active people
├── user.md               # User profile — preferences, corrections, patterns (NEW in v4)
├── triage-log.md         # Append-only log of commit-triage decisions (v4.2+)
├── archive/              # Archived nodes
├── person/               # Person pages (v4.2+) — graduated contacts only, not every mention
│   └── sarah-chen.md
├── client/               # Node files organized by prefix
│   └── acme-corp.md
├── strategy/
│   └── q2-growth.md
└── hiring.md             # Unprefixed nodes live at root
```

Node-to-file mapping: `client:acme-corp` → `memory/client/acme-corp.md`, `person:sarah-chen` → `memory/person/sarah-chen.md`. Nodes without a prefix map directly to `memory/{node}.md`. Create directories as needed.

### Person pages (v4.2+)

`memory/person/<firstname-lastname>.md` holds a canonical view of contacts the user actually interacts with. Pages are **usage-graduated, not mention-graduated** — a casual mention in conversation does NOT create a page. A person becomes a page when ANY of:

1. `contact-researcher` (lead-engine) produces a dossier — the dossier IS the initial page
2. `/recall person:<slug>` is invoked 3+ times (counter at `memory/.person-recall-counter.json`)
3. `project-setup` names them as the primary contact for a new engagement
4. They appear in `time-log.csv` with a billing-contact role
5. Explicit `[ENTITY:person]` tag in a `/remember` commit
6. They're the attendee of 3+ meetings on the calendar over a rolling 30-day window

Mention-count alone is too noisy. Usage signals real interest.

**Schema** — each page follows this structure:

```markdown
# person:firstname-lastname

> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Identity
- **Full name:** ...
- **Title / role:** ...
- **Company:** ... (link to cortex node if relevant, e.g., [client/acme-corp])
- **Email:** ...
- **LinkedIn / other:** ...
- **First mentioned:** YYYY-MM-DD (source)

## Relationship
- **How we know each other:** ...
- **Relationship temperature:** [Cold | Warm | Active | Dormant]
- **Last meaningful contact:** YYYY-MM-DD ([type: email / meeting / DM])
- **Relationship owner:** [you, or someone else]

## Recent interactions (last 90 days, append-only)
- YYYY-MM-DD — [type] — one-line summary

## Open threads
- [WAITING:them] — ...
- [WAITING:you] — ...
- [P0] — ...

## Notes
- [Free-form context]

## Linked entities
- Projects: [client/...], [bizdev/...]
```

**Name-collision rule** — if two people would slug to the same name (e.g., two Sarah Chens), append a company hint to the slug: `sarah-chen-acme.md`, `sarah-chen-globex.md`. When a new page is about to be created and a same-slug page exists, the creating plugin must prompt the user to disambiguate before writing.

**Cross-plugin writes** — multiple plugins write to person pages, always additively (append to Recent interactions, update Last meaningful contact, never overwrite Notes or Identity without explicit user confirmation). See each plugin's CHANGELOG for which sections it touches.

### Decay model (v4.4+)

Every knowledge entry carries `[confirmed:YYYY-MM-DD] [recalled:YYYY-MM-DD]` tags. `confirmed` updates when the entry is re-affirmed; `recalled` updates when `/recall` surfaces it. Entries pass through four states based on the age of `confirmed:`:

- **Fresh** — within `threshold_fresh` days (default 60)
- **Stale** — `threshold_fresh` to `threshold_dormant` (60-180 default); `/recall` flags `[stale-confidence]`
- **Dormant** — `threshold_dormant` to `threshold_cold` (180-365 default); `/rehearse` surfaces for triage
- **Demoted** — moved by user action to `## Demoted knowledge` section at bottom of node
- **Archived** — moved to `<config-root>/memory/archive/`

Defaults configured at `<config-root>/memory/.decay-config.md`. Per-type modifiers (GOTCHA and RECIPE decay 1.5× slower; CORRECTION never decays). Per-node `decay_profile: fast | normal | slow` in front-matter for nodes with faster/slower turnover.

Full spec at `references/decay-model.md`. Forgetting is bidirectional with learning — `/remember` adds, `/recall` flags aging, `/rehearse` consolidates, `/cleanup` audits.

### Demoted knowledge convention (v4.4+)

When the user demotes a knowledge entry (via `/recall` recall-time action, or via `/rehearse`, or as a supersede from `/remember`'s concept-drift detection), the entry moves to a `## Demoted knowledge` section at the bottom of its node file. The entry stays readable; it just renders below active content in `/recall`, gets de-prioritized by `memory-librarian`, and is excluded from `/rehearse` selection.

Format:

```markdown
## Demoted knowledge

[node-id] INSIGHT (YYYY-MM-DD): [body] [confirmed:YYYY-MM-DD] [recalled:YYYY-MM-DD]
  ↳ demoted YYYY-MM-DD by [user-action | supersede], reason: [...]
  ↳ superseded by: [reference to new entry, if applicable]
```

`/forget --revive <entry-ref>` (planned for later) brings an entry back to active.

## Always-On Behaviors (v4)

These run automatically in EVERY conversation. No commands needed.

### 1. Auto-Recall (conversation start)

1. **Read `user.md`** first. Apply preferences silently — communication style, tool preferences, known corrections. Never announce this.
2. **Read `DASHBOARD.md`**. Check for overdue P0s (3+ days), stale threads (3+ sessions). If the user's first message is a greeting, briefly surface attention items (max 8 lines). If nothing needs attention: "All clear — what are we working on?"
3. **If the user references a known project/topic**, read that node file and weave context into your response naturally.

### 2. Passive Observation (during conversation)

Silently watch for and queue these for commit at conversation end:
- **Corrections** — user fixes your approach → always capture (highest priority)
- **Preferences** — communication style, tool choices, working patterns
- **Domain knowledge** — company/team/industry facts shared in passing
- **Relationships** — who's who, roles, org context

Rules: Never interrupt to capture. Adapt behavior in real-time. Queue for end-of-conversation commit.

### 3. Contextual Recall (mid-conversation)

When the user mentions a project, person, or topic with memory, surface the 1-3 most relevant pieces naturally. Don't dump a recall block — weave it in: "Heads up — Acme's procurement requires 3 vendor quotes even for renewals."

### 4. Auto-Commit (conversation end)

When the conversation ends (farewell signals, task complete):
1. Assess value: Were decisions made? Knowledge shared? Corrections given? If trivial → skip.
2. Commit silently — no "Want me to save?" prompt, no confirmation output.
3. User observations → `user.md`. Project knowledge → project node files. Update `DASHBOARD.md`.
4. Exception: if creating a NEW node, briefly mention it.

## Knowledge Taxonomy

Memory captures three categories: **project state** (decisions, threads, blockers, artifacts, next actions), **knowledge** (reusable insights), and **user observations** (preferences, corrections, patterns).

Knowledge entry types — first-class, high-value content:

| Type       | When to use                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| INSIGHT    | New realization or connection                       |
| LESSON     | Something tried that worked or failed               |
| MODEL      | How something works (process, workflow, system)     |
| GOTCHA     | Trap, hidden requirement, or non-obvious behavior   |
| RECIPE     | Reusable technique, playbook, or process            |
| CORRECTION | Updated or reversed belief                          |

User observation types (stored in `user.md`):

| Type       | When to capture                                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| PREFERENCE | Communication style, tool choices, working patterns |
| CORRECTION | User fixed your approach — what was wrong → right   |
| PATTERN    | Repeated working behaviors (after 2+ signals)       |
| MODEL      | Domain expertise, company/industry knowledge        |
| PEOPLE     | Relationships, org context, communication prefs     |

## Auto-Fire Triggers

When you detect these patterns, run the corresponding command automatically. **Claude Code:** use `.claude/commands/` when present. **Cowork:** the plugin loads from `commands/`.

| Pattern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Conversation start, greeting | Auto-recall (load user profile + attention items) |
| Conversation end, farewell, "thanks", "goodbye" | Auto-commit (silent extraction + observation flush) |
| "save this", "remember that X", "commit this to memory" | Run `/remember` — full session extraction with confirmation |
| "catch me up", "status of X", "where did we leave off" | Run `/recall` — load project, person (`person:slug`), or topic context |
| "TIL", "gotcha:", "the trick is...", "I was wrong about X" | Run `/learn` — capture standalone knowledge |
| "note that", "jot down", "quick note" | Run `/note` — one-liner capture |
| "any gotchas with", "what's blocked", "what are my P0s" | Run `/search` — cross-project search |
| "weekly review", "summarize my week" | Run `/review` — synthesized digest |
| "what have I been working on", "timeline of X" | Run `/timeline` — chronological view |
| "archive X", "close out X" | Run `/forget` — archive or remove node |
| "clean up memory", "what's stale" | Run `/cleanup` — maintenance audit |
| "is this still true", "rehearse my memory", "what should I confirm or forget" | Run `/rehearse` — aging-knowledge triage (v4.4+) |

## Slash Commands

If `.claude/commands/` is present, these slash commands are available:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/remember` | End-of-session commit — extracts state + knowledge + observations |
| `/recall [target]` | Load context for a project, person, topic, or full dashboard |
| `/learn [node] [type?] [content]` | Capture standalone knowledge entry |
| `/note [node] [content]` | Quick one-liner to changelog |
| `/search [query]` | Cross-project search across all memory |
| `/review [--since] [--until]` | Synthesized weekly digest |
| `/timeline [project?] [--since] [--until]` | Chronological activity log |
| `/forget [node] [--archive\|--merge target]` | Archive, merge, or remove a node |
| `/cleanup` | Memory health audit and maintenance |
| `/rehearse` | Aging-knowledge triage — surfaces 3-5 stale entries and asks "still true? still useful?" (v4.4+) |

## Per-Project Config

If `.cortex.json` exists in the project root, respect its settings:
- `node`: Default project node for this directory
- `capture`: `"aggressive"` / `"normal"` (default) / `"minimal"` (explicit commands only)
- `auto_recall` / `auto_commit` / `observe`: Toggle behaviors (default: true)

## Behavior

- Knowledge entries are the highest-value content — surface them prominently, preserve them longest.
- Living summaries are replaced each session. Changelogs are append-only.
- Priority tags: `[P0]` do now, `[P1]` this week, `[P2]` eventually, `[WAITING:person]` blocked.
- Staleness: `[FRESH]`, `[ONGOING]`, `[STALE]` (3+ sessions without progress).
- Node activity: Active (7d), Warm (8-14d), Cooling (15-30d), Dormant (30+d).
- Don't fabricate memory. Only surface what's actually committed.
- User profile preferences → apply silently, never announce.
- Auto-commit → silent unless creating a new node.
