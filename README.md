# Session Memory Plugin v2.2

**Build persistent intelligence — project state AND knowledge — across your working world.**

Most AI conversations are disposable. This plugin makes them cumulative. Every session can produce two kinds of value: **what changed** (decisions, actions, progress) and **what was learned** (insights, gotchas, mental models, techniques). This plugin captures both and makes them retrievable.

Works for any kind of work — client engagements, business development, strategy, operations, hiring, research, learning, and technical projects.

## Quick Start

| You want to... | Command |
|----------------|---------|
| Save a session's context and knowledge | `/remember` |
| Load context before starting work | `/recall [project]` |
| Look up how something works | `/recall [topic]` or `/search [topic]` |
| Quickly capture a gotcha or technique | `/learn [node] [content]` |
| Jot down a quick fact | `/note [node] [content]` |
| Get a weekly digest | `/review` |
| See what happened chronologically | `/timeline [project?]` |
| Archive a finished project | `/forget [node]` |
| Run memory maintenance | `/cleanup` |

---

## What gets captured

Every `/remember` extracts two categories:

### Project State — what changed
- **Decisions made** — what was resolved and why
- **Open threads** — things started but not finished
- **Blockers** — what's preventing progress and who owns it
- **Artifacts** — docs created, proposals sent, decks built
- **Next actions** — prioritized (P0/P1/P2/WAITING)

### Knowledge — what was learned
- **Insights** — "Realized our churn is an onboarding problem, not a product problem"
- **Lessons** — "Tried same-day proposals — close rate dropped. 48-hour tailored decks close 3x better"
- **Mental Models** — "Their approval flow: dept head → finance → VP → procurement"
- **Gotchas** — "Their fiscal year starts April, not January — adjust all budget timing"
- **Recipes** — "For exec buy-in: lead with their metric, show the gap, propose one action"
- **Corrections** — "They're not price-sensitive — they need ROI framing for internal approval"

Knowledge entries are the highest-value content. They persist longer than session logs and surface automatically when you need them.

## Commands

### Core — Commit & Recall

#### `/remember`
End-of-session commit. Extracts project state and knowledge, tracks people, spots cross-project signals. Works equally well for a strategy session, a client call debrief, or a pure learning session.

#### `/recall [project | @person | topic]`
Start-of-session context loading:
- **Project**: full state + knowledge base + threads + actions
- **Person**: cross-project profile (which projects, what they own, open items)
- **Topic**: everything known about a subject across all projects
- **No argument**: working world dashboard with all active projects at a glance

### Quick Capture

#### `/learn [node] [type?] [content]`
Capture a single piece of knowledge — no full session extraction needed:
```
/learn client:acme gotcha Their procurement requires 3 vendor quotes even for renewals
/learn bizdev:partnerships model Channel partners want co-marketing before signing
/learn strategy:pricing lesson Usage-based pricing confused mid-market buyers — flat tiers landed better
/learn domain:healthcare recipe For HIPAA BAAs: send our template first, let their legal redline, then negotiate
```
Types: `insight`, `lesson`, `model`, `gotcha`, `recipe`, `correction`. Auto-inferred if omitted.

#### `/note [node] [content]`
Fastest capture — one line, no ceremony:
```
/note client:acme Kim confirmed March 15 deadline
/note hiring Sent offer letter to Jordan for ops manager
/note strategy:pricing Competitor just dropped entry tier to $29/mo
```

### Analysis

#### `/search [query]`
Cross-project search. Finds knowledge, decisions, people, artifacts, blockers, actions:
- "how does their approval process work" → finds MODEL entries
- "any gotchas with Acme's procurement" → finds GOTCHA entries
- "what worked for retention" → finds LESSON entries
- "what's my P0 list" → unified action list across all nodes

#### `/review [--since date] [--until date]`
Synthesized weekly review (not just a timeline — an analytical digest):
- **Progress**: what moved forward
- **Learned**: new knowledge committed
- **Stuck**: blockers and stale threads
- **Decided**: key decisions for accountability
- **Coming Up**: P0/P1 actions across all projects
- **Connections**: cross-project patterns and signals

#### `/timeline [project?] [--since date] [--until date]`
Chronological activity log with velocity assessment and arc analysis.

### Maintenance

#### `/forget [node] [--archive | --merge target]`
Archive (default), merge, or delete project nodes. Cleans up cross-references.

#### `/cleanup`
Memory health audit: stale threads, dormant nodes, orphaned entries, duplicates.

## Memory Types

Knowledge entries persist longer than logs — they're the highest-value content.

### Project State
| Entry | Format | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Summary** | `[node] SUMMARY (date): ...` | Replaced each session (always current) |
| **Changelog** | `[node] LOG date — title: ...` | Append-only (never modified) |

### Knowledge
| Entry | Format | When to use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Insight** | `[node] INSIGHT (date): ...` | New realization or connection |
| **Lesson** | `[node] LESSON (date): tried → happened → takeaway` | Something that worked or failed |
| **Model** | `[node] MODEL (date): ...` | How something works (process, workflow, system) |
| **Gotcha** | `[node] GOTCHA (date): ...` | Trap, hidden requirement, or non-obvious behavior |
| **Recipe** | `[node] RECIPE (date): name — when → how` | Reusable technique, playbook, or process |
| **Correction** | `[node] CORRECTION (date): old → new` | Updated or reversed belief |

### Cross-cutting
| Entry | Format |
|-------|--------|
| **People** | `[node] PEOPLE: Name (role) — context. Also in: [nodes]` |
| **Signal** | `[node] SIGNAL from [other-node] (date): implication` |
| **Archive** | `[node] ARCHIVED (date): compressed summary` |

---

## Priority System

Next actions: `[P0]` do now, `[P1]` this week, `[P2]` eventually, `[WAITING:person]` blocked on someone.

## Staleness Tracking

Threads: `[FRESH]`, `[ONGOING]`, `[STALE]` (3+ sessions without progress).
Nodes: Active (7 days), Warm (8-14), Cooling (15-30), Dormant (30+).

---

## Node Conventions

Use kebab-case. Organize however fits your work:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Client work | `client:acme-corp`, `client:northstar` |
| Business development | `bizdev`, `bizdev:stripe-partnership` |
| Internal ops | `company-ops`, `hiring`, `finance`, `brand` |
| Strategy/planning | `strategy:q2-growth`, `strategy:pricing` |
| Products/services | `onboarding-program`, `crm-dashboard` |
| Learning | `learning:sales-ops`, `learning:ai-tools` |
| Domain knowledge | `domain:tax-law`, `domain:healthcare-compliance` |
| Research | `research:competitor-landscape` |
| Infrastructure | `infra:crm`, `infra:data-pipeline` |
| Personal | `personal`, `personal:finances` |

---

## Auto-firing Skills

All commands also exist as skills that trigger from natural language:

| Trigger pattern | Skill |
|----------------|-------|
| "save this", wrapping up, "remember that X" | `remember` |
| "catch me up", "status of X", "how does X work" | `recall` |
| "TIL", "gotcha:", "the trick is...", "I was wrong about" | `learn` |
| "note that", "jot down", "quick note" | `note` |
| "when did we decide", "any gotchas with", "what's blocked" | `search` |
| "weekly review", "summarize my week", "what did I accomplish" | `review` |
| "we're done with X", "archive X" | `forget` |
| "what have I been working on", "show last week" | `timeline` |
| "clean up memory", "what's stale" | `cleanup` |
