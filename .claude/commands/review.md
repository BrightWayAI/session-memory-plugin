# /review $ARGUMENTS

Generate a weekly (or custom period) review that synthesizes project activity and learning into a shareable digest.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for optional flags: `--since [date]` and `--until [date]`.

---

### Data Source

Memory is stored at `~/Documents/Claude/memory/`.

1. Read `memory/DASHBOARD.md` for the overview
2. Read node files for any nodes updated within the review period
3. Focus on: new knowledge entries, decisions in changelogs, changes in P0/P1 actions, resolved vs. new threads

---

## Step 1 — Determine scope

- Default: last 7 days
- Custom: use `--since` and `--until` if provided
- Pull: all LOG entries, knowledge entries, SIGNAL entries, and current SUMMARYs within the period

---

## Step 2 — Synthesize by category

Don't just list entries chronologically (that's `/timeline`). Synthesize into themes:

```
## Weekly Review — [date range]

### Progress
[Which projects moved forward and what was accomplished. Group related activities across days. Be specific: "Shipped X", "Resolved Y", "Decided Z".]

### Learned
[New knowledge committed during this period. The most interesting/useful INSIGHT, LESSON, MODEL, GOTCHA, RECIPE, CORRECTION entries. This is the "intellectual growth" section.]

### Stuck
[Projects with unresolved blockers, stale threads, or no activity. What's preventing progress and what needs to happen to unblock.]

### Decided
[Key decisions made during this period, with brief reasoning. Useful for accountability and revisiting later.]

### Coming Up
[P0 and P1 actions across all projects. What needs attention this week.]

### Connections
[Cross-project signals that fired. Knowledge from one project that applies to another. Patterns across projects.]

---

**By the Numbers**
- Projects touched: [count]
- Sessions logged: [count]
- Knowledge entries committed: [count]
- Decisions made: [count]
- Open threads: [count] ([count] stale)
- Blockers: [count] active
```

---

## Step 3 — Highlight notable items

Call out 1-3 things worth the user's attention:

```
### Worth Noting
- [Something that might get lost in the noise but is important]
- [A pattern across projects — e.g. "You've been context-switching heavily between 4 projects this week"]
- [A stale thread that's becoming urgent]
- [A correction that changes how a prior decision should be viewed]
```

---

## Step 4 — Offer export

"Want me to format this for Slack/email? Or commit any reflections from this review to memory?"

---

## Behavior notes

- This is synthesis, not listing. Add structure and insight.
- If the period was quiet (few entries), say so: "Light week — only [count] sessions across [count] projects."
- If the period was intense, note the intensity: "Heavy week — [count] sessions, [count] decisions, [count] new knowledge entries."
- Don't fabricate activity. Only surface what was committed.
- The "Learned" section is what makes this different from a standard status report — treat it as a first-class section, not an afterthought.
- If certain projects dominated the period, note the allocation: "80% of activity was on [node] — other projects may need attention."
