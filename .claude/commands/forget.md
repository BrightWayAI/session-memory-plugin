description: Archive or remove a project node from working memory. Supports full removal, archival, or merging two nodes together.

# /forget $ARGUMENTS

You are modifying the project memory graph. This is a destructive operation — confirm with the user before proceeding.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:
- **Node ID**: Which node to forget (required)
- **Flags**: `--archive` (default), `--merge [target-node]`, or no flag

---

## Step 1 — Validate the node

Memory is stored at `~/Documents/Claude/memory/`.

Search memory for the specified node. If it doesn't exist, tell the user and list the nodes that do exist.

If it exists, show the user what will be affected:
```
## Forgetting: [node-id]

**Living Summary**: [the current summary]
**Changelog entries**: [count] entries spanning [earliest date] to [latest date]
**People entries**: [count] people indexed under this node
**Signals**: [count] cross-project signals involving this node
```

---

## Step 2 — Determine the operation

### Default: Archive (safe)
Compress all memory for this node into a single archival entry, then remove the individual entries:
```
[node-id] ARCHIVED (YYYY-MM-DD): [1-2 sentence summary of what this project was and how it concluded]. Key decisions: [top 3]. Key people: [names]. [count] sessions logged from [start] to [end].
```

This preserves searchability while freeing memory space.

### With `--merge [target]`: Merge into another node
Move all relevant context from the source node into the target node:
- Append a LOG entry to the target noting the merge
- Transfer any people entries
- Transfer any open threads or next actions
- Delete the source node's entries
- Update the target's living summary to reflect the merged context

### Full removal (only if user explicitly says "delete" or "remove completely")
Remove all memory entries for this node. This is irreversible.

---

## Step 3 — Confirm

**Always ask for explicit confirmation before executing.** Show exactly what will happen:

```
I'll [archive/merge/delete] the [node-id] node. This will:
- [action 1]
- [action 2]
- [action 3]

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

Wait for confirmation before modifying memory.

---

## Step 4 — Execute and report

### File Operations

- **Archive** (default): Move the node file from its current location to `memory/archive/{filename}`. Remove the node's entry from DASHBOARD.md Active Nodes. Add a one-line entry to the Dormant or a new "Archived" section in DASHBOARD.md.
- **Merge**: Read both node files. Append source's changelog, knowledge, and people entries to the target file. Delete the source file. Update DASHBOARD.md.
- **Delete**: Remove the node file entirely. Remove from DASHBOARD.md.

After execution, confirm what was done:
- For archive: "Archived [node-id]. It's searchable but won't appear in dashboards."
- For merge: "Merged [source] into [target]. Updated [target]'s summary."
- For delete: "Removed all [count] entries for [node-id]."

---

## Step 5 — Clean up cross-references

After archiving/deleting, scan for:
- SIGNAL entries in other nodes that reference this node — update them to note the node is archived/deleted
- PEOPLE entries in other nodes that mention this node — update the "Also in:" list
- Any WAITING actions in other nodes that depend on this node — flag them for the user

---

## Behavior notes

- Default to archive, not delete. Data loss should require extra intent.
- If the node has open P0 or P1 actions, warn the user before proceeding
- If the node has cross-project signals to active nodes, flag this
- Never archive/delete `personal` without strong explicit confirmation
